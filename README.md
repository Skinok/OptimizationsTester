# OptimizationsTester

This is a Qt Creator Plugin. It will be used to quickly test some code optimizations and learn from various optimizations examples.
This plugin will be designed for new developers to help them optimize their source code.

First tab will be used to test custom source code (before/after optimization) and will show basics results (time elapsed, %..) about execution time

Second tab will show various source code optimizations usually found online among most common cases.

**Not working yet ! In progress Job...**

Todo list : 
- [X] Create Github and project structure
- [X] Design QML : "Live coding" tab
- [X] Create XML file & code the XML reader to load examples data
- [X] Create Model class to easily interact with QML in MVC behvior
- [X] DistFiles are not copied in the build dir, must find why
- [X] Create a project skeleton (framework) to handle user code by adding key feature like time calculations...
- [X] Find a way to compile the source code wrote in the "Live coding" tab through Qt Creator kits
- [X] Work on the Plugin QML window
- [ ] Add a QML Ui for Optim Runner window (currently in console mode)
- [ ] Improve test results prceision by runnig multiple threads and average the execution time between them
- [ ] Design QML : "Optimization examples" tab
- [ ] Add source code examples in the library
- [ ] ...
